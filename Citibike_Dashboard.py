    The station at W 21 St & 6 Ave stands out as the most frequented starting and ending point for Citi Bike trips. 
    Interestingly, all of the top 20 stations are located in Manhattan, despite it being the third most populous borough in New York City. 
    This suggests that the popularity of Citi Bike stations isn‚Äôt necessarily tied to population density.

    With the exception of one station, the most popular starting stations also happen to be the most popular ending stations, 
    which might point to commuters being a primary user group. However, the concentration of popular stations near major tourist attractions‚Äîsuch as Central Park, Washington Square Park, etc‚Äîsuggests 
    that tourism is a key driver of demand. These stations likely see high traffic due to their proximity to iconic New York destinations.

    **Seasonal Demand:**
     - Peak usage occurs in spring and summer (March‚ÄìAugust).
     - Usage declines sharply in winter months (December‚ÄìFebruary).
     - Electric bike usage increases in summer, despite potential battery heat issues.

    **Actionable Insights:**
      1. Increase bike availability during high-demand months (March‚ÄìAugust).
      2. Offer winter discounts to boost off-season ridership.
      3. Monitor electric bike batteries during extreme temperatures.

    **Observations:**
      - Electric bikes dominate usage, year-round, suggestion their convenience and efficency appeal to both members and casual users.
      - Usage of eletric bikes still sees a noticeable increase in summer, likely due to higher tourism and longer trips.

    **Recommendations:**
      1. Expand the fleet of electric bikes to meet growing demand.
      2. Monitor battery performance, especially in extreme weather conditions(both heat in summer and cold in winter).
      3. Highlight the benefits of electric bikes in marketing campaigns to further encourage adoption by casual and new riders.
