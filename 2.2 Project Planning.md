## List of Dashboard Elements

1. **Line Chart**:
   - Plot the number of trips for each month as one line and combine it with the average monthly temperature in a second line.
   - This will show whether thereâ€™s a relationship between the temperature and the number of bikes used.

2. **Map**:
   - Plot the most common bike trips with aggregation to distinguish one-time trips from recurring ones.

3. **Bar Chart**:
   - Plot the number of rentals at a given station, that is filterable by month of the year and day of the week.

## Questions to Guide the Analysis

### 1. What are the most popular stations in the city?
   - **Analysis**: Use a bar chart that displays the top bike stations by total rental numbers, possibly breaking down rentals by different time intervals (e.g., month, day, or hour).
   - This will provide insights into station popularity and help identify high-traffic stations.

### 2. Which are the months with the most trips taken? Is there a weather component at play?
   - **Analysis**: A line chart combining average temperature with the total number of rentals will provide insights into seasonal trends.
   - If the line for temperature and bike rentals shows a similar pattern, this could indicate that weather impacts bike usage.

### 3. Are the stations evenly distributed across the city?
   - **Analysis**: A map will show the location of bike stations.
   - Additionally, you can color-code the map to show bike station density and add trip data to visualize high-traffic areas.
